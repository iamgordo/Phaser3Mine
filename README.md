# Phaser3Mine
 My crack at a Phaser 3 Platformer!  I love to code, I have since I was 11 or 12 on a Vic 20 using BASIC, I'm 53 now and I still enjoy putting projects together and watching them run!  Phaser 3 is a piece of cake to work with and it makes me really look like I'm good at this.  Download and enjoy if you want to! Requires no fancy NPMs or dependencies... everything is there!! Just download run and use arrows to move, up arrow to jump.  I'm not at all a pro so I don't expect it to be seizure inducing fun :-)  I learned by reading code so I hope to give others insight into designing simple games by reading my code. It's not perfect but it's (mostly) readable.
